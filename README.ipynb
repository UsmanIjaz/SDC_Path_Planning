    "### Simulator.\n",
    "You can download the Simulator which contains the Path Planning Project from the [releases tab (https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases/tag/T3_v1.2).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals\n",
    "In this project our goal is to safely navigate around a virtual highway with other traffic that is driving +-10 MPH of the 50 MPH speed limit. We are provided the car's localization and sensor fusion data, there is also a sparse map list of waypoints around the highway. The car should try to go as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, which means passing slower traffic when possible, note that other cars will try to change lanes too. The car should avoid hitting other cars at all cost as well as driving inside of the marked road lanes at all times, unless going from one lane to another. The car should be able to make one complete loop around the 6946m highway. Since the car is trying to go 50 MPH, it should take a little over 5 minutes to complete 1 loop. Also the car should not experience total acceleration over 10 m/s^2 and jerk that is greater than 10 m/s^3.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The map of the highway is in data/highway_map.txt\n",
    "Each waypoint in the list contains  [x,y,s,dx,dy] values. x and y are the waypoint's map coordinate position, the s value is the distance along the road to get to that waypoint in meters, the dx and dy values define the unit normal vector pointing outward of the highway loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "The highway's waypoints loop around so the frenet s value, distance along the road, goes from 0 to 6945.554.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Sensor Fusion Data, a list of all other car's attributes on the same side of the road. (No Noise)\n",
    "\n",
    "[\"sensor_fusion\"] A 2d vector of cars and then that car's [car's unique ID, car's x position in map coordinates, car's y position in map coordinates, car's x velocity in m/s, car's y velocity in m/s, car's s position in frenet coordinates, car's d position in frenet coordinates. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Details\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The car uses a perfect controller and will visit every (x,y) point it recieves in the list every .02 seconds. The units for the (x,y) points are in meters and the spacing of the points determines the speed of the car. The vector going from a point to the next point in the list dictates the angle of the car. Acceleration both in the tangential and normal directions is measured along with the jerk, the rate of change of total Acceleration. The (x,y) point paths that the planner recieves should not have a total acceleration that goes over 10 m/s^2, also the jerk should not go over 50 m/s^3. (NOTE: As this is BETA, these requirements might change. Also currently jerk is over a .02 second interval, it would probably be better to average total acceleration over 1 second and measure jerk from that.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. There will be some latency between the simulator running and the path planner returning a path, with optimized code usually its not very long maybe just 1-3 time steps. During this delay the simulator will continue using points that it was last given, because of this its a good idea to store the last points you have used so you can have a smooth transition. previous_path_x, and previous_path_y can be helpful for this transition since they show the last points given to the simulator controller with the processed points already removed. You would either return a path that extends this previous path or make sure to create a new path that has a smooth transition with this last path.\n",

    "## Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "A really helpful resource for doing this project and creating smooth trajectories was using http://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/, the spline function is in a single hearder file is really easy to use.\n",

    "\n",
    "We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to\n",
    "keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend\n",
    "using the following settings:\n",
    "\n",
    "* indent using spaces\n",
    "* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Style\n",
    "\n",
    "We did our best to stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Takeaways\n",
    "- The car drives according to the speed limit.\n",
    "- Max Acceleration and Jerk are not Exceeded.\n",
    "- Car does not have collisions.\n",
    "- The car stays in its lane, except for the time between changing lanes.\n",
    "- The car is able to change lanes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reflection\n",
    "The path planning algorithms start at src/main.cpp line 209 to the line 469. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Prediction\n",
    "In src/main.cpp from line 209 to the line 304, the code deals with the telemetry and sensor fusion data. The intention here is to reason about the environment of ego car. Here we check if the can move ahead, move right, move left or simply slows down.The idea here is that if it is dangerous to drive the car ahead,right or left, then car should slow down. Danger is defined as if there is a car in the same lane as ego car and the distance between two is 30 meters, or if there is a car in adjacent lanes within 30 meter range of the ego car. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Behavior\n",
    "In src/main.cpp from line 308 to the line 338, we find the answer to the questions like:\n",
    "- If there is a nearby car ahead of ego, do we change lanes?\n",
    "- When does the car speed up or slow down?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trajectory\n",
    "In src/main.cpp from line 344 to the line 469, code does the calculation of the trajectory based on the speed and lane output from the behavior, car coordinates and past path points."
